# Simple Provider Example

A simple Flutter project that demonstrates how to use the `provider` package to toggle between dark and light themes in a Flutter app.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flutter-provider-theme-toggle.git
```

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE or editor.

3. Install dependencies using `pub`:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

4. Run the app on your preferred device or emulator:

```bash
flutter run
```

## Usage

The app provides a simple UI with a button to switch between dark and light themes. The `ThemeProvider` from the `provider` package is used to manage the app's theme.
